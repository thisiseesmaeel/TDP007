# TDP007 - Computer Language Construction

The overall goal is that the students will become better at using different programming languages and also construct their own languages. To achieve this, we will look at different types of programming languages, how to define them and how to build tools for them. By studying the principles of how programming languages are constructed, one becomes better at exploiting the languages one already knows, but also better at choosing a language that fits the problem one is working with.
